                <h3>Affordable and Clean Energy</h3>
                <span class="cETL">Affordable and clean energy is a cornerstone of sustainable development, aiming to ensure universal access to reliable, renewable, and cost-effective energy sources while reducing environmental harm. This goal aligns with United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7), emphasizing energy accessibility, efficiency, and the transition to renewable energy. </span>
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="cET"><span class="cETM">Accessibility:</span> Millions worldwide still lack access to electricity or rely on unsafe and inefficient energy sources, such as wood or kerosene, for basic needs like lighting and cooking. Affordable clean energy systems, such as solar home kits or mini-grids, can provide reliable power to remote and underserved communities.</span>
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="cET"><span class="cETM">Clean Technologies:</span> Renewable energy sources like solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power offer sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels. These technologies produce minimal greenhouse gas emissions, mitigating climate change and improving air quality. Innovations in energy storage and smart grids enhance their reliability and efficiency.</span>
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="cETL"><span class="cETM">Economic Benefits:</span> Affordable energy drives economic growth by powering industries, creating jobs in the renewable energy sector, and reducing energy costs for households and businesses. Investing in clean energy infrastructure often leads to long-term savings and energy security.</span>
